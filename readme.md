# post cheka userscript


Make sure Tampermonkey is installed in your browser:

* [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

Then install post cheka here:

[install](https://github.com/sonofevil/post-cheka-js/raw/master/Reddit_Post_Cheka.user.js)

Places a scan button next to usernames.

This script only works in the old Reddit layout! (see old.reddit.com)

Update: Works on user profile pages in mobile browser now.
